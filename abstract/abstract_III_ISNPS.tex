% Brief abstract of the paper
\abstract{
Software packages for randomization inference are few and far between.
This forces people either to write one-off programs or to rely on classical statistical tests that may be inappropriate for their particular data.
As Python picks up steam as a language for data analysis, the absence of a package for randomization inference presents a severe gap in the software's statistical capabilities.
We develop \texttt{permute}, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive package for randomization inference in Python.
We illustrate the program's capabilities with three examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item a randomized experiment comparing the student evaluations of male and female instructors \citep{macnell:article}
\item a study of the correlation between salt consumption and mortality on the level of nations
\item assessing inter-rater reliability of eight raters who rated multiple time points in ten videos
\item \textbf{potential other option: constrained matrix permutation with Stefan's shark data, or other education evaluation data}
\end{itemize}
We discuss future plans for the software's development.
