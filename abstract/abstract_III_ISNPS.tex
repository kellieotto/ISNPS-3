% Brief abstract of the paper
\abstract{
Software packages for randomization inference are few and far between.
%Most resampling packages are stand-alone programs or part of proprietary software, and are written to handle a narrow range of problems.
This forces researchers either to rely on specialized stand-alone programs or to use classical statistical tests, which may require implausible assumptions about their data-generating process.
As Python gains popularity as a language for carrying out data analysis from start to finish, the absence of a package for randomization inference presents a severe limit to users' statistical capabilities.
We present \texttt{permute}, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive Python package for randomization inference.
We illustrate the program's capabilities with three examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item a randomized experiment comparing the student evaluations of teaching for male and female instructors \citep{macnell:article}
\item a study of the association between salt consumption and mortality at the level of nations
\item an assessment of inter-rater reliability for a series of labels assigned by multiple raters to video footage of children on the autism spectrum
\end{itemize}

We discuss future plans for \texttt{permute} and the role of software development in Statistics.
